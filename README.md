# Draw Lines (Canvas)

## Functionality:

#### - Creating line! Adding a line with two mouse clicks (the first click creates the first position; then the user moves the mouse and the line becomes visible; if the user left-clicks again, the line is added to the image; if the user starts drawing and clicks the right mouse button, we do not draw the line.
#### - Show intersects! If a line intersects, show red dot (independent of line status - creating or added) 
#### - Collapse lines! When the user clicks “collapse lines”, the lines collapse to the center of the line as a 5 second animation.
